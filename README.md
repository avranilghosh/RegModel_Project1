## Overview

This course project for Regression Models by Johns Hopkins University Coursera is to analyze the [mtcars][mtcars_doc] data (included in the the base version of R) using linear regression models.

### Assignment Context

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
* "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

### Assignment Question

Take the [mtcars][mtcars_doc] data set and write up an analysis to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses.

Your report must be:

* Written as a PDF printout of a compiled (using knitr) R markdown document.
* Brief. Roughly the equivalent of 2 pages or less for the main text. Supporting figures in an appendix can be included up to 5 total pages including the 2 for the main report. The appendix can only include figures.
* Include a first paragraph executive summary.
